📖 About README_DEV.md
This project also includes a file called README_DEV.md.
👉 This is my personal developer guide, where I have documented:

React app flow (how index.html, index.js, and App.js connect)

Detailed file explanations (manifest.json, robots.txt, etc.)

My own notes for quick revision

⚡ README.md (this file) is for others to understand the project.
⚡ README_DEV.md is for myself to revisit and quickly understand the codebase.
